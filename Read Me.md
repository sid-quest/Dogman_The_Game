## About the game
I have always loved videogames, from the old cartridge games to the Playstation 2 and early windows games. I've always found videogames very intriguing. But with the mobile gaming industry bringing in ads and pay-to-win models, I found games to be tiresome and so I sought to bring the experience back to the players. This is my honest attempt at it. 

**The Style**

I really loved the looks of the old games on the monochrome screens of old Nokia brick phones and how well they looked, and so the game uses a similar color scheme recreating the monochromatic style.

This game is in truest sense a nod to my experience growing up

**The Story**

You're in a fictional version of Kochi, India. Fighting enemies and travelling across the city to find bosses who have stolen stuff from you. There are plenty of references to the city. There isn't much to the story as my primary focus was gameplay mechanics and GI/GX and much of the story was built after the fact.

**Use of AI in the game**

As much as I hate the environmental impacts of using chatbots I did have to resort to asking for ChatGPT's help every now and again. But much of the work has been done by me manually using Youtube as my guide.

## Note to Player

Thank you for trying my game, unfortunately if you're playing the game on Safari the text might be not spaced right due to Safari's own line height configuration and I intend on correcting this in the future.

For a more smoother gameplay experience it is advised to use **Chrome, Firefox or Opera**.

On your phone you will find a add to Homescreen option which will allow the game to run in full screen for a better gameplay experience.

Since the game is running through your browser it can't really be paused unless you manually pause it each time you close it.
